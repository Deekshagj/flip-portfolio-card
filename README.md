# flip-portfolio-card
This is a webpage that incorporates the flip concept via which a person's portfolio can be mentioned.
The front of the card contains a image. When the card is hovered it flips to reveal the description and links to social media.
I worked on this in the process of developing a website for STIC Innovation Club.
The images and links must be changed according to one's needs.
